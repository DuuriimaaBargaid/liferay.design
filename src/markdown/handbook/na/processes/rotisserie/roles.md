## Presenter

Fill out the first portion of your Google Doc in the [sessions folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=116aLZ08AySaz6hKS7CZsKgjD1jzAsnl5) by 12:00pm on Wednesday to present.

### Presentation Pointers

1. Give context to your project. Not everyone knows what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.
    - It’s important to tell people the problem you were presented and what the goal of the stakeholders is.
1. Show your research.
    - Present research addressing the proposed problem. This allows the group to evaluate what the root issue may be and how to solve the problem/ accomplish the goal.
    - We don’t want you to waste your time assuming that you are solving a specific issue when the root problem is something else.
1. Iterate.
    - Bring iterations. It’s good to see and share your design thinking.
1. Red card when it isn’t useful.
    - You have the power to keep your discussion on track. Use the red card when the discussion has derailed and is no longer addressing the issue you presented.
    - If the discussion derails but is helpful, you have the power to change the topic to something else, as long as it is within your allotted time.

## Facilitator

As a facilitator, make sure the session runs smoothly:

-   Preparation
    -   Create a new session by duplicating the -week-template in the sessions folder and renaming it to the presentation date.
    -   Slackbot currently reminds presenters to fill out the first portion of their own Google Docs at 9:30am on presenting day — use this thread to ask who will be sharing stuff today.
        -   sessions folder > [session week] > [presenter doc]
    -   Prior to the critique session, open all presenters’ presentation links to make sure they are viewable and do not require additional viewing permissions.
    -   Bring Post-It notes, pens, and timer from the UX Cubby (Suite 150 Cubby 31).
-   Keep time
    -   10 Minutes Total per Designer
    -   03 Minutes for Presenter
    -   07 Minutes for Critique
-   Keep Discussions on Track
    -   Keep feedback relevant to the problem the designer is trying to solve.
    -   Remind session members of the problem.
-   Get Everyone Involved
    -   Try to get everyone involved in the critique, not just the few talkative individuals.
-   Record Critique Session
    -   Record feedback for the presenter at the bottom of their Google Doc.
        -   sessions folder > [session week] > [presenter doc]
-   Remind Next Facilitator
    -   The Facilitator changes each week, going in alphabetical order by last name (i.e. week 1 is Connolly, week 2 is Hanaoka, etc).

## Critic

As a critic, understand the project/design better and share knowledge, suggestions, and ideas as to how it can be better.

### Do:

1. Ask lots of questions for clarity and better understanding.
    - Things that are unclear for you may be unclear for others.
1. Give constructive criticism
    - The goal of constructive criticism is to point out why a current design or solution does not work (in the perspective of the critic) and what potential solutions are there.
1. Give positive feedback
    - Positive feedback tells the designer what works and why it works
    - This is not simply a morale booster but a guide for what has worked when designing future iterations
1. Feedback needs to stay within the scope
    - The presenter is coming into the session looking for feedback on few things; don’t derail the conversation by critiquing what is outside of the scope, it catches the presenter off-guard and can waste time
1. Personal Feedback after the session
    - If you have feedback, tip and tricks, or other things not within the scope of the critique, meet with the person afterwards
1. Write your feedback on post-its.
    - Write your thoughts and feedback on post-its for the presenter to look back at.
1. Guide discussions with questions rather than suggestions.
    - Make the presenter describe his/her design thinking and rationale behind decisions.

### Don't:

1. Have your devices out during the critique
    - Give the presenter respect by paying attention and giving good feedback.
1. Talk about what you like/don’t like or looks good/doesn’t look good
    - “I like that” and “That looks good” are completely subjective; try talking about what works and why it works.
1. Attack the presenter
    - Critique the work, not the worker
    - Help the presenter become a better designer by critiquing their work.

> “In the best critiques we’ve seen, the critics never made a single recommendation. Instead, they asked questions and guided discussion. They talked about the significance of design rationale as it pertained to a bigger philosophy and vision for the design.”
