A list item is a flexible component arranging the data in different ways. Here are a few examples.

### Basic
The most simple list item just showing the main text.

### With description
A list item for versions. It shows its author and creation date.

### User 
A list item for users. If select multiple users is needed, place a checkbox on the left side.

### File
A list item showing who last modified the file and when. Additionally, it has a status label.

### Notifications
If a list item needs support for notifications, place an 8px width line on the left side of the row for an unread notification. The main text for a read notification must be regular.
